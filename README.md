This repository contains two different versions of a to-do list application, showcasing various approaches to building the same functionality using different technologies. Both versions implement core features like adding, deleting, but they use different tech stacks to achieve similar results.

## Branches

The repository contains two branches:

- **[Vanilla_JavaScript_Page](https://github.com/Klimentina2709/To-Do-App/tree/To-Do_Vanilla_JavaScript)**: Contains the to-do app built with plain JavaScript, HTML, and CSS.
- **[React_Page](https://github.com/Klimentina2709/To-Do-App/tree/To-Do_React)**: Contains the to-do app built with React, TypeScript, and Material-UI.

## Purpose

The purpose of creating these two versions was to practice and compare different web development approaches:

- **Vanilla JavaScript**: Focuses on core web development skills without any frameworks, demonstrating manual DOM manipulation, event handling, and styling.
- **React**: Uses modern web development practices with React, including component-based architecture, state management, and the use of libraries like TypeScript for static typing and Material-UI for styling.
